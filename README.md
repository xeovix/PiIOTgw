# PiPAL-Workbench (WB)

A home automatic and industry control platform for Raspberry Pi.

#### **Overview** 

The PiPAL-WB is a series of HATs (Hardware Attached on Top) for All Raspberry Pi modules, which offers RS232/RS485, Digital IO, Analog Input, USB, Ethernet to integrate a Platform for home automatic and industry control.

According to the purpos and necessity, user can install the different image on SD, then make PiPAL WB to be the different device for home automatic or industry control. such as data collector, AOI (Automatic Optical Inspection), PLC (Programmable Logic Controllor), Security/Surveillance system, Gateway and so on.

Install the Gateway image to SD card, an embedded HMI offering the dashboard for each IO pins, and using browser of smart phone to view it. Enhanced automation capabilities include built-in data logging, virtual HMI and an advanced web server. Direct

Support MQTT, OPC UA, MOD Bus and IIoT Cloud connectors, communicate with most any brand of PLC or other equipment, and securely transmit data to wherever it is required. Enhanced automation capabilities include built-in data logging, virtual HMI and an advanced web server.

Install the AOI image to SD card, the PiPAL WB can be treat as a programmable controllor or a slave control module which connected by a host PC to manipulate to, with the on-board I/O, you can enable direct control by PC.
